# Create a python program named "task2", and use the built-in function 'print' in it several times.
# Try to pass "sep", "end" params and pass several parameters separated by commas.
# Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above,
# with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.
#
# (Ex.
# # 'hello world'
# print("hello world")
# )

# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!
print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sep=', ', end='!\n')

# 1
# 2
print(1, 2, sep='\n')

# 123
print(1, 2, sep='', end='')
print(3)
